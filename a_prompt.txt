Read this prompt when you need to recalibrate, refocus, or when context seems unclear.

## PROJECT IDENTITY

**Project Name:** Kırmızı Vosvos Official Website
**Client:** Kırmızı Vosvos (Turkish Music Group)
**Location:** /Users/serkan/Documents/kvwebsite/
**Plan Document:** implementationplan.md (ALWAYS UPDATE THIS)

---

## WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING

A modern, CMS-powered music band website based on the MOUSIQUA HTML template.

**Source Template:** `/Users/serkan/Documents/kvwebsite/MOUSIQUA /HTML/`
**Key Constraint:** PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL DESIGN - do not redesign, do not "improve" the aesthetics.

---

## TECHNOLOGY STACK (LOCKED IN)

| Layer | Technology | DO NOT CHANGE |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| Frontend | Next.js 14 (App Router) | Yes |
| Language | TypeScript | Yes |
| CMS | Sanity.io | Yes |
| Styling | Original CSS files | Yes |
| Deployment | Vercel | Yes |

---

## CORE EXPECTATIONS

### 1. DESIGN PRESERVATION
- Use the EXACT CSS from the template (bootstrap.css, base.css, main.css, fonts.css)
- Keep the same color scheme (#13181d dark, #ff5252 red accent)
- Maintain the same layout, spacing, and typography
- Do NOT add Tailwind styling that conflicts with original design
- Do NOT "modernize" or "improve" the visual design

### 2. CMS FUNCTIONALITY
The client must be able to edit ALL content through Sanity Studio:
- Hero slides (images, text)
- Albums and tracks (with audio upload)
- Band member profiles
- Tour dates and venues
- Photo gallery
- News/blog posts
- Contact information
- Social media links

### 3. DOCUMENTATION
- UPDATE implementationplan.md after EVERY significant change
- Log all design choices with reasoning
- Document all issues and their resolutions
- Track progress in the Progress Log section
- Mark tasks as completed when done

### 4. CODE QUALITY
- Use TypeScript strictly (no `any` types)
- Create reusable components
- Follow Next.js 14 App Router conventions
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Comment complex logic only

---

## CURRENT PHASE CHECK

Before continuing work, verify:
1. What phase am I in? (Check implementationplan.md)
2. What tasks are pending in this phase?
3. What was the last thing completed?
4. Are there any unresolved issues?

## COMMON DEVIATIONS TO AVOID

### DON'T:
- Start over or restructure without explicit user request
- Add features not in the original template
- Change the visual design
- Use different libraries than specified
- Skip updating implementationplan.md
- Leave tasks half-finished
- Forget to copy original CSS/fonts/images

### DO:
- Ask if unclear about requirements
- Update documentation as you work
- Test each component matches original design
- Preserve all original CSS classes
- Keep the same HTML structure in JSX
- Commit logical chunks of work

## RECOVERY CHECKLIST

If you're lost or confused:

1. [ ] Read implementationplan.md completely
2. [ ] Check the Progress Log for last activity
3. [ ] Review the Pending Items section
4. [ ] Look at Issues & Resolutions for context
5. [ ] Verify current file structure exists
6. [ ] Check what phase should be active
7. [ ] Ask user for clarification if needed

---

## USER COMMUNICATION STYLE

- Be concise and direct
- Show progress clearly
- Update the plan document, then summarize changes
- Ask focused questions when blocked
- Don't over-explain or add unnecessary commentary

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

The project is successful when:
1. Website looks identical to MOUSIQUA template
2. All content is editable via Sanity Studio
3. Site is deployed and accessible on Vercel
4. implementationplan.md is fully updated with all phases completed
5. User can independently update content without code changes

---

## REMEMBER

You are not creating a new design. You are converting an existing HTML template to a modern stack while preserving its exact appearance. The template is the source of truth for all visual decisions.

When in doubt: MATCH THE TEMPLATE.
